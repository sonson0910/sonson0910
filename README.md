# About Me

Hi there! I'm Son, a passionate technologist with a diverse background in Artificial Intelligence and Blockchain technology.

With over 4 years of experience in AI, I've worked on various projects involving machine learning, deep learning, and data science. My proficiency in multiple programming languages like Python, Java, C++, and Typescript, Haskell, Rust and Aiken, ... has allowed me to tackle a wide range of technical challenges.

Additionally, I have 3 years of experience in Blockchain, particularly with Cardano. I'm fascinated by the potential of decentralized technologies and have a deep understanding of Cardano's architecture and smart contracts.

I'm always eager to learn and stay updated with the latest trends in AI and Blockchain. I enjoy contributing to open-source projects and sharing my knowledge with the community.

Let's connect and see how we can collaborate or learn from each other!
